**Made with :heart: for smart clean coders**


## A try to port "decorator" feature from python language to laravel framework.



![python-and-prey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6961695/51078481-a2ad9300-16ca-11e9-8bf2-1d4ed214e030.jpg)

#### You might say, why such a horrible header :scream: is chosen for a laravel package ?! You will shortly see why...

### :truck: Installation :

```
composer require imanghafoori/laravel-decorator
```



### What is a `"Decorator"` :question:

A decorator is callable which wraps around the original decorated callable, in order to form a new callable composed of the previous two.

Like a python snake swallowing a deer whole and wraps around it's body !

After that the snake becomes capable to eat and digest grasses :herb: but only if the deer is still alive.

Technically, A `"Decorator"` :

1 - Is a "callable" (python is an animal)

2 - It takes a "callable" as it's only argument (like a python swallows an other animal)

3 - It returns a newly born `"callable"` that calls that `callable` (and turns into a bloated animal surrounding it.)

**What ?!??! ?!!? ?!?!? ???!** (0_o)

#### What is a "`callable`", man ?!

Long story short, A callable (here in laravel) is anything that can be called (invoked) with `\App::call();`


## A Use Case: 

### Cache Like a Pro:

Imagine that you have a `MadController`which calls a `MadRepository` to get some `$mad` value.

Then after a while you decide to put a cache layer between those two classes for obvious reasons, but both controller and repo class are so mad, that they do not allow you to touch a single line of their code.

According to SOLID principles, you can not, (or maybe you CAN but shouldn't) put the cache logic in your controller or your repository.

You want to add a new feature (caching in this case) without modifing the existing code.

It smells like `Open-closed Principle` Yeah ?! üëÉ 

And you want to keep the responsibilities seperate. In this case `caching` should not be in a repository or controller but in it's own class. 

It smells like `Single Responsibility Principle` yeah ?! üëÉ 

**(Or maybe both `MadRepository` and `MadController` are imprisoned in the `vendor` folder and are part of a laravel package, so you can not touch them)**

```php

class MadController extends Controller
{
    public function index () {
    
        // we don't want to put any cache logic here...
        
        $madUser = MadRepositoryFacade::getMadUser($madId);
        ...
    }
}

```

So, what now ?!

With the help of laravel-decorator built-in cache decorator, you can go to `AppServiceProvider.php` (without any mad person realizing it.) üòÅ 

```php
<?php

use Imanghafoori\Decorator\Decorators\DecoratorFactory;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {

    public function boot( ) {

        $keyMaker = function ($madId) {
            return 'mad_user_key_' . $madId;
        };
        
        MadRepositoryFacade::decorateMethod('getMadUser', DecoratorFactory::cache($keyMaker, 10));
    }
}

```
Just that.

You will get cached results from your Facade calls, in your entire app without changing a single line of code !!

```php
// you get cached results then ! Nice ?!
$madUser = MadRepositoryFacade::geMadUser($madId);

```


Here we return a callable that calls the original callable and casts it's result into string.


**So Let's apply this to decorate on the baz method on the Bar class :".**

Alternatively, you can use the `\Decorator` facade to do so



**It's time to enjoy having a decorated call :"**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6961695/50968397-2bbca280-14f0-11e9-85c9-4112e14da056.png)

**Note:** finally a closure is returned here (not the actual value)

### Sample decorators:

For good working examples please take a look at the tests folder.


### Naming Your Decorators:

```php

public function boot () {
    \Decorator::define('myDecoratorName1', 'SomeClass@someMethod');
    
// or

    \Decorator::define('myDecoratorName2', function ($callable) {
        return function (...) use ($callable){ ... } 
    });
}

```
Then you can use this name (`myDecoratorName`) to decorate methods.


### How to apply a decorator on a method ?

```php

// You may set multiple decorators on a single method...

\Decorator::decorate('class@method, 'someClass@someOtherDecorator');

// or reference the decorator by it's name :

\Decorator::decorate('class@method, 'myDecoratorName');

```


### How to call a method with it's decorator ?

## Decorate Facades :

### Decorating Facade Methods

First, you should extend the `Imanghafoori\Decorator\DecoratableFacade` class (instead of the laravel base Facade).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6961695/51075625-484d0c00-16a3-11e9-9551-73b199a9c5e9.png)


#### Now You Can Apply Decorators in your ServiceProvider's boot method:

then if you call your facade as normal you get decorated results.

### :warning: Warning :

With great power, comes great responsibilities.

Remember not to violate the `Liskoves Substitution Principle` when you decorate something.

For example a method call which returns `int|null` should not unexpectedly return a `string` after being decorated.

`$result = app('decorate')->call(...`

Since the users of the method should be ready for type of value they get back.

But if you return only `int` and your decorator causes the `null` value to be filtered out. that's ok.
